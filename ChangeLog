No ChangeLog file
=================

Do not modify the ChangeLog file of QGpgME.  We put change information
only in the GIT commit log, and generate a top-level ChangeLog file from
logs at "make dist" time.  As such, there are strict requirements on the
form of the commit log messages.  See doc/HACKING for details.

Change information before QGpgME was added to g10 Code's gpgme repository
has been imported into g10 Code's gpgmeqt repository from KDE's kdepim
repository and KDE's kdepimlibs repository when the gpgmeqt repository was
split from the gpgme repository.  The commit logs before the merge of the
aegypten_branch on 2004-02-09 are "lost" in KDE's svn repository backups.
