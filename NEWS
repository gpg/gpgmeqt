Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.0 (unreleased)
-------------------------------------------------

 * First separate release of QGpgME.

 * cmake: The qgpgme folder containing the header files is no longer exported
   as include directory. All headers have to be included with the prefix
   qgpgme/ now. The camel-case headers are still included with the prefix
   QGpgME/.

 * Added function returning the ordered list of attributes of a DN.

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.24 branch of gpgme:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
